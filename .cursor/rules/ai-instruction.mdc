# Coding Guidelines for Playwright-MCP Project

## 1. File Interaction
- Always interact only with files located in the `.` folder.
- Do not read or modify files outside this folder.
- Do not modify files outside `ai-generated` folders.

## 2. Page Object Model (POM)
- Always use the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern for structuring UI automation code.
- Store all page object files in:  `pages\ai-generated`

## 3. Spec Files
- Always create spec/test files in:  `tests\ai-generated`
- Do not place spec files outside this folder.

## 4. MCP Usage
- When interacting with code, always use **playwright-mcp** for all test execution and automation tasks.
- Ensure any automation scripts leverage MCP commands for consistency and logging.

## 5. Prevent Auto-Generated / Random Spec Files
- Do not allow LLM or MCP to create random spec files like `urltest_<uuid>.spec`.
- Ensure AI-generated spec files are only created in `tests\ai-generated`.

## 6. General Notes
- Follow consistent naming conventions for pages and specs.
- Keep code modular and reusable within the defined folder structure.
- Review MCP logs to debug test execution if necessary.
